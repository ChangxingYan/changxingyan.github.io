            <p style="margin-top: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Project Summary
				</strong></span><br>
			  <br>Our project is a puzzle-adventure game that is developed with Maya and Unity. It takes the form of a first-person 3D walk simulator. The player acts as a girl who was assigned an unfinished mission by her ancestor. </br>
As a puzzle-adventure game, it contains some logic puzzles that leads to clues in boxes, and exploration plays a large part of storytelling. The player can investigate objects in the environment to get information (through monologue of the main character and dialogue with ghosts). </br>
I work as the programmer in the group. In the beginning phase of production, the group members discussed and decided the main storyline and designed the game space together.</br>
<strong>storyline & game logic:</strong></br>
The girl’s ancestor was an astronomer two thousand years ago. In his time, he saw evilness prevail and people suffer. Therefore, at the end of his life, he carried out a powerful magic with the energy of a supernova to supress the evils in the world. But he knew, when the supernova casts its light on the earth, the magic would lose its strength. To prevent the return of dark era, he also put a spell on his own blood, so when the time comes, his descendant would take the responsibility to re-assign his magic onto another star. </br>
the players must search in the game environment for useful information that can help her to understand the situation and guide her behaviour. There are 4 puzzles in the scene, and each of them contains either an object or a useful piece of information. After obtaining information in the environment and solving all the puzzles, she would be able to combine the clues at hand and solve the final puzzle that is embedded in the environment. Then, as the gate of mansion opens, the evil is awake, she has to use a seal at a certain place to disempower the evil while avoiding being killed by the evil.</br>
<strong>Puzzle 1: Narrative Puzzle with password lock box</strong></br>
The clue for correct password is a book that lost its page of 4 and 12. After giving the right password, the player will find a map of the house in the vault.</br>
Puzzle 2: narrative puzzle with keycode lock</br>
The clue of this puzzle scattered in several places. First, player should talk to a ghost in the room, who will tell the player to pay attention to the blue things in the room. Then, player would see a blue arrow on the wall outside of the window. Finally, she would find 4 blue books lining up on the shelf in the room, and the initial letter of the 4 books would be the key pass. From this player would be given two documents that suggests the way to open the gate and how to disempower the evil. </br>
<strong>Puzzle 3: mechanical block slide puzzle</strong></br>
Player must put all blocks into their right place, and the reorganized picture is going to be used in the final puzzle.</br>
<strong>Puzzle 4: Narrative Puzzle with password lock box</strong></br>
Another environment-dependant narrative puzzle. The player would find 2 memos saying HIDDEN and IHDDNE. Aligning them and connect the same letters would show up a pattern of XIIX, the number it represents would be the passcode for the lock. In it there is a magical seal used to defeat the evil. </br>
<strong>Puzzle 5: environmental puzzle</strong></br>
From the first puzzle and the third puzzle, the player will obtain two sheets. The picture obtained in puzzle 3 actually resembles the tiles in the living room. When the player places the star map onto the picture, they will match each other and show a specific spot that is on the floor of living room. The player must step onto the particular spot in the living room after having obtaining the seal. And then the gate will be open. </br>
<strong>Final goal</strong></br>
In puzzle 2, the player would know, that she must put the seal onto an altar in the yard in order to trigger the magic again. But as the evil is awake, it would kill her with a touch. She would have to reach the altar to eliminate the monster and finish the mission.</br>
As a very story-centric game, the puzzles actually function as obstacles on the way of finishing this game. Only if the player solves all the puzzles could she make some changes happen in the game, mechanically and narratively.

			<br>This is the second game project I made at Digital Media Production programme at UCL. This time it is a puzzle adventure game which involves many interersting game mechanics.  Many part of this game are done with help of online tutorials, such as the block slide puzzle, keypads and save-load system.
